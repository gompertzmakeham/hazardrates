Hazard Rates
============

Proactive methodological disclosure of a high resolution precision calibrated measurement of the Gompertz-Makeham Law of Mortality in annual census data consolidated from the healthcare administration data of all publicly funded services of a single geopolitical jurisdiction. This repository only contains the source code, and only for the purpose of peer review, validation, and replication. This repository does not contain any data, results, findings, or discussions.

This code base is under active development, and is currently being tested against a data store of approximately 3 billion health utilization events, each containing roughly a couple hundred features, across 19 distinct data sets, covering approximately 6 million individual persons from the year 1993 to present day. The core of source code dimensionally reduces the health events using measure theoretic consistent temporal joins implemented in poorman's map-reduce steps to generate approximately 300 million intervals of time.
